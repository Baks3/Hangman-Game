# Hangman Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

## 📝 How to Play
1. Run the game script.
2. Enter your name to start.
3. You have **10 attempts** to guess the word correctly.
4. Input a single letter per turn.
5. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.
6. If the letter is not in the word, you lose a turn and part of the hangman is drawn.
7. If you guess the word before running out of turns, **you win!** 🎉
8. If you use all 10 attempts, **you lose!** The hangman is fully drawn. ☠️

```sh
